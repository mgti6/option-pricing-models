# ðŸ“Š Option Pricing Models in Python

This repository presents three fundamental option pricing models implemented in Python:

- ðŸ§  **Black-Scholes Model** â€“ Analytical formula for European options  
- ðŸŽ² **Monte Carlo Simulation** â€“ Probabilistic method using asset path simulations  
- ðŸŒ³ **Binomial Tree Model** â€“ Discrete-time model for pricing with flexibility  

## ðŸ“˜ Model Descriptions

### ðŸ”¹ Black-Scholes Model  
An analytical model for pricing European call and put options. Assumes:
- Constant volatility and interest rates  
- Log-normal distribution of stock prices  
- No dividends or transaction costs  

### ðŸ”¹ Monte Carlo Simulation  
Simulates thousands of potential paths for the underlying asset and calculates the average payoff discounted at the risk-free rate. Useful for complex path-dependent options.

### ðŸ”¹ Binomial Tree Model  
Constructs a recombining binomial tree of possible stock prices and evaluates option prices by backward induction. Can handle American and European options but here we will focus only on European option.
